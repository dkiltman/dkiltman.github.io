title: The First of the Blogs
---

Today I publish my first blog, as directed by the illustrious...person...at [Ropper's academy](https://academy.hoppersroppers.org/).  

For now I'll keep it short and sweet.  The purpose of this blog is to:

1. Announce my projects when I publish them in Github
2. Anotate my progress for when I rule the world in 10 years. 
3. Track the likely decline of my mental stability
4. Publish funny pictures I find on the internet.

So far, I have created this blog page as the only project outside of the github tutorials.  Onward and upward.
